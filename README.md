# Xautogen

Xautogen modifies the X-Plane default autogen houses to hide the ground textures. This might be usefull if you use Ortho SAT images as ground textures while still using the default autogen sceneries instead senery packages like Simheaven's X-World.

Xautogen works with X-Plane 11 and X-Plane 12
